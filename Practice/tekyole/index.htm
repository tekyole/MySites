<!-- Main content -->
<p> 
The main purpose of this website is to provide a quick review of the important topics that Electrical and Computer Engineers deal with in their daily life. Although I may add some tutorials at some point but the main idea here is that if you are heading to a job interview or to a technical meeting, you browse the topics related to your job interview or meeting and not to stumble upon basic concepts and jeopardize your career.   <br /><br />This website is <strong>under construction </strong>, I will continue updating it. I have tons of stuff to add here, so if you find it useful, keep visiting it...
