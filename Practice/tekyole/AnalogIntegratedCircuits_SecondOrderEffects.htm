		<strong>- What is Body effect?
		</strong> <br /> The voltage applied to the bulk contact can affect the threshold voltage of a MOSFET transistor. The common practice is to make MOS transistors on a common substrate. Therefore, the substrate voltage of all transistors is equal. However when transistors are connected serially, it may result in increase in source-substrate voltage as we proceed vertically along the series chain (that is Vsb1 = 0, Vsb2 != 0).Which results in Vth2 > Vth1. <br />-----

		<strong>- What is Latch up?
		</strong> <br /> The condition in which the parasitic components (parasitic thyristor) establish a low resistance conducting path between VDD and VSS is called latch up. Examples of parasitic bipolar transistors that may be formed in CMOS circuits are: (a) vertical PNP transistors formed by a p-substrate, an n-well, and a p-source or p-drain. (b) lateral NPN transistors formed by an n-source or n-drain, a p-substrate, and an n-well.
		<br /> Solution: Placing substrate and well contacts as close as possible to the source connections will reduce the Rw (parasitic resistance in the n-well structure whose value ranges from 1KW to 20kW) and Rsub (substrate resistance) values.

		<strong>- What is Antenna effect? 
		</strong> <br /> It is a side effect of the manufacturing process, where under certain conditions, plasma etchers or ion implanters induce charge onto various structures that are connected to a gate of a transistor. These induced charges overstress and can damage the thin gate oxides of the transistor. The antenna effect has become a big problem as the transistor sizes have shrunk. That is because the gate size gets smaller and more metals are added to the chips, and thickness of the gate oxide is reduced. <br />-----
